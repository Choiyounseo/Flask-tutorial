####Part21 : User Notifications

* WebSocket is a protocol that unlike HTTP, establishes a permanent connection between the server and the client
  * the server and the client can both send data to the other party at any time, without the other side asking for it
*  It is for this limitation that WebSocket applications are typically designed around *asynchronous servers*, because these servers are more efficient at managing a large number of workers and active connections
* The good news is that regardless of the method that you use, in the client you will have a callback function that will be invoked with the list of updates
*  jQuery's `$(function() { ...})` pattern in [Chapter 20](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-xx-some-javascript-magic). This is how you register a function to execute after the page loads
